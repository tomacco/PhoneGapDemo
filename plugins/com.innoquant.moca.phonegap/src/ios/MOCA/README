INSTALLATION
------------

For iOS8+ use drag and drop MOCAKit.framework into your app project in XCode.
Ensure it is added in 'Embedded Binaries' section of General target tab as well as
it is listed in "Linked Frameworks and Binaries" section.

The framework is a universal FAT binary compiled for the following architectures:
- armv7/armv7s/arm64/x86_64/i386

To support iOS 6 and 7 apps, use static library libMOCALib.a provided in the bundle.
The library is a universal FAT library compiled for the following architectures:
- armv7/armv7s/arm64/x86_64/i386

Ensure the following frameworks and libraries are added as binary dependencies:
- MobileCoreServices.framework
- SystemConfiguration.framework
- CoreBluetooth.framework
- CoreLocation.framework
- UIKit.framework
- AudioToolbox.framework
- libsqlite3.0.dynlib
- PassKit.framework (optional)
- AdSupport framework (optional, if the app uses Ads)

For iOS 8, ensure the NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription property is added to your plist.
For example:

NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription=This app will use your location information to identify nearby places and to notify you about available proximity experiences.

In app capabilities, ensure the following entitlements are enabled:
- Background fetch
- Remote notifications

Optionally, link PassKit.framework to use Passbook experiences in your app.

CHANGELOG
-----------

v.1.8.9
- Updated device type detection: iPad Pro, iPad Mini 4, iPhone 6s, 6s plus
- Track Ad ID only if AdSupport framework is linked with the app
- Track new app properties: device screen size, default URI schema
- Track tag event
- fix: some logs were printed even when log was set to off. (#107)
- API change: MOCAProximityActionsDelegate changed to support full customization.
- Moca Device Identifier - share same ID across apps with MOCA SDK (AppIdentity:getOrCreateVirtualDeviceIdentifier)
- Track BLE status (3 new variable: BleState, BlePowerOnCount, BlePowerOffCount)
- Segments (simple, complex, tags) 

v.1.8.0
- Rich Push notifications
- Push analytics

v.1.7.0
- Adds country/lang/etc. fields to campaign analytics
- iOS 9 support.
- Bitcode support.
- HTTPS support. All MOCA communications use HTTPS MOCA Device API endpoint.

v.1.6.9
- FIX: Background task no longer runs when app is in foreground

v.1.6.8
- Enhancement: Better integration with Cocoapods

v.1.6.7
- FIX: Driver is no longer stopped when user turns bluetooth off

v.1.6.6
- New flag in the MOCAConfig.plist: BACKGROUND_LOCATION_ENABLED allows to disable tracking when app goes to background.
- Fix: GEOLOCATION_SERVICE_ENABLED flag is now evaluated before askking for location (Wi-Fi / Cellullar / GPS) updates.

v.1.6.5
- Enhancement: enter/exit zone is now fired when device approaches a beacon in any proximity range (immediate/near/far).
  Before that version, the trigger was called only when device approached near or immediate beacon proximity.
- Fix: OnZoneExit logic was corrected.

v1.6.4
- Fix: place overlay always on top in app top window.
- Add API callback to customize where to show the overlay window.

v1.6.3
- Critical bug fix for iOS 8.3. AutoLayout constrain violation: "A multiplier of 0 or a nil second item together with a location for the first attribute creates
  an illegal constraint of a location equal to a constant. Location attributes must be specified in pairs".
  This bug affects all apps with MOCA SDK 1.6.3 running on iOS 8.3.
- Bug fix: persist experience fired at timestamp after app kill / restart to guarantee consistent repeat frequency.

v1.6.2
- Updated API in MOCAProximityActionsDelegate. Previous methods deprecated (but still working).
  Enables custom delegate to get access to MOCAAction class and underlying action details such as background alert text.

v1.6.1
- Improved beacon ranging in background. The SDK uses now maximum available time doing ranging (up to 190 seconds) after being woken up in background.

v1.6.0
- Major refactoring of MOCA iBeacons driver to improve detection of beacon enter/exit region events when the app has been killed.
  In some situations when the app has been killed by the user or OS, the detection of beacons may take up to several minutes
  after the user turn the screen on or unlocks the phone.

v.1.5.3
- MOCA JavaScript API for HTML creativities: html content delivered by MOCA may now access instance/user properties from within SDK.
  UIWebView uses JavaScript-to-Objective-C bridge to communicate both environments.

v.1.5.2
- Bug fix: auto register for push notifications called even if disabled
